    "## Building a Convnet with CPU\n",
    "Image classification is notoriously computation heavy and it can take a long time to train up a functioning model without the aid of high-performance GPU. I wanted to see what was possible with, and what the limitations are of tackling a challenge like this with a CPU-only machine. These are the steps I took to create a classifier with non-trivial performance:\n",
    "\n",
    " - Use a pre-trained convnet: VGG16 trained with ImageNet (includes many dog breeds)\n",
    " - Strip \"top,\" flattened layers from model to access raw image features\n",
    " - Build new classifier on top of pre-trained VGG16 convolutional layers\n",

    "## Holdout Group and Data Preparation\n",
    "To prepare the images for processing, I use Scikit-Learn stratified split. To play nice with the keras ImageDataGenerator, I organize the photos (after resizing to 224x224 pixels) into folders by breed class, in one directory for training (80% of photos) and another for validation (20% of photos.) That script can be found <a href='https://github.com/AlliedToasters/dogs/blob/master/make_holdout.ipynb'>here</a>.\n",

    "## Extracting \"Bottleneck\" Features\n",
    "Running the VGG16 convolutional layers on my CPU machine is a very lengthy process (about 4 hours to get through all 10,222 photos.) To avoid running each photo through the convnet more than once, I save the output of each of the images into a numpy array file (.npy). I use the keras ImageDataGenerator to aid in that process by \"feeding\" the images to the model. This process was taken from <a href='https://blog.keras.io/building-powerful-image-classification-models-using-very-little-data.html'>this helpful tutorial</a> on the Keras blog.
